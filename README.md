# genome sequence classification 🧬
## ML olympiad: genome sequences classification
### goal: building a machine learning model which genomes can be classified accurately
### context:
Since a genome sequence is different for every living being, the ability to determine the species of the organism from its genome could be very helpful for research and biology-related works. 
However, it is difficult to perform this task without comparing the DNA of this organism to the DNA of creatures of the same species.
The participants will have to create models to classify the genome sequences of Human vs Gorilla based on their genome sequence.

-> 순서를 그대로 두고
-> 단어 하나하나를 벡터화시킴
-> ∴순서가 존재할 수 있는것
-> DL 자연어 처리 모델 전단계에서 사용한다
